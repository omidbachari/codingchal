Thank you for visiting my super homemade website! I have included the following content on this single-page site:

<p style="text-indent:10px;"><b>A note before you proceed:</b>

<br>
<br>

I am aware that you'll be looking under the hood, you smarty pants. Therefore, I have tried to make this simple website's code more readable with neat and tidy spacing. I am sure you'll find room for improvement--aircraft hangar size. However, since I do not know the best practices for making the code readable, you might find some of that formatting to be superfluous. I hope, at any rate, that the under-the-hood formatting is preserved.

<h2 style="text-indent:10px;"><b>3 Reasons Launch Academy Should Snatch Me Up</b></h2>

<p>

<h4 style="text-indent:10px;"><b>First</b></h4>

I am making a career change for happiness (which is the right kind of reason to make a career change). And seeking out happiness is a major factor in the story of my life. So, why would programming make me happy? I started a career change brainstorm in 2013. Since my life has centered around formal education for so long, I brainstormed through college websites and majors. I found that my logical and creative side would both be indulged with programming, which is great.

<br>
<br>

I also discovered a computer science professor's short description of why programming is a great career choice. What he said had a big impact on me. He said that programming is unlike most forms of technical expertise--like engineering or lab science. He said that it's uniquely team-oriented and collaborative. Creativity and taking risks are encouraged. Excellence is expected. And the culture of programming is inclusive and informal. I am sure that not all programming communities or workplaces are like that, but I will find that and that's where I know I will be the most fulfilled.

<h4 style="text-indent:10px;"><b>Second</b></h4>

I believe in community. The main reason why I want to use my talents at Launch Academy is because you make a big deal about how the cohort works together. That makes me excited.

<br>
<br>

But let's wait a minute. Why is community important? Is it just a way to hang out and make new friends? No. The reason I believe that a professional community is important is because it hold us accountable and it makes growth more accessible. I will break that down. On one hand, accountability is boosted in a professional community. You can't shirk your duties as easily when you are integrated in a team that cares and who depends on you. On the other hand, it's easier to grow into a better developer. That's because diverse strengths will be discovered and the team will gravitate toward those strengths, pulling everyone up a notch.

<br>
<br>

<h4 style="text-indent:10px;"><b>Third</b></h4>

Let's get real for a second: I want to create great code. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction when piecing together a philosophy paper, an appellate brief, or systematically overcoming a prospect's objections to a sale--to close the deal. I like making sure the details are tight and I involve smart friends to double check me. I take pride in my work and I go all in. I bet Launch Academy would welcome that type of person. I want to do excellent work.

<br>
<br>

<h4 style="text-indent:10px;"><b>So, when can I start?</b></h4>
